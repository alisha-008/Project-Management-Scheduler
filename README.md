# Project-Management-Scheduler
A Python-based Project Management Scheduler that implements First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm to manage team tasks. This application allows adding team members, creating tasks with time estimates, assigning tasks, and visualizing the project schedule with waiting/turnaround time metrics.

Key Features
Member Management: Add and manage team members

Task Management: Create, update, and track project tasks

FCFS Scheduling: Implements First-Come-First-Served algorithm

Time Metrics: Calculates waiting time and turnaround time

Visual Schedule: Displays formatted schedule with averages

Interactive CLI: User-friendly command-line interface

Error Handling: Validates inputs and handles edge cases

Algorithm Used
First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling:

Processes tasks in the order they're added

Calculates start/end times sequentially

Computes waiting time and turnaround time

Non-preemptive (tasks run to completion)
